Combat is very straightforward in this game. 

 - Attacking is done by the player whose turn it is. 
 - There is no defined “Attack Step” during the turn. Attacks can be made before or after playing other cards and abilities.
 - The active player chooses which creatures attack and which enemy creatures receive the damage. 
 - A protected Figurehead within the Think Tank cannot be attacked unless the opponent’s Active Zone contains no Creatures.
