Limits and Tips

A Mondo Megabits deck must meet the following constraints:
Minimum 40 cards total in the deck
Maximum 3x any one card per deck

Note: While it is recommended to devote a portion of your deck to the Figurehead subtype of Creature (for their increased utility and abilities), a deck is not required to include any Figureheads if the player doesnâ€™t want to. 

Note: While the above is true, as of now it would be very difficult to win a game without any Creatures in the deck, especially when omitting both Figureheads and high INT Creatures. This game is largely based around Creature presence on the board, so you are encouraged to use them when building your first decks.
