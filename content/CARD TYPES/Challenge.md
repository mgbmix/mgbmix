Challenges are a [[CARD TYPES/Card Type|card type]] that offers players a one-time chance to fulfill requirements and reap benefits.

### Rarity-based Funding Cost

> [!warning]+ Challenge cards have a variable [[Funding Cost]] depending on their rarity, equal to 2 points plus half that card’s rarity level (rounded down).
>  
> [[R1]] = [[2F]]  
> [[R2]] = [[3F]]  
> [[R3]] = [[3F]]  
> [[R4]] = [[4F]]  
> [[R5]] = [[4F]]  
> [[R6]] = [[5F]]  

A Challenge deployed for its cost can remain on the battlefield until the controller chooses to use it. Only the controller of the Challenge card can use its effects.
 
> [!abstract] Instead of paying the Funding cost for a Challenge, a player has the option to [[deploy]] it at zero cost as a “free contest” challenge.

## Free Contest Challenges

A free contest Challenge allows players to get the effects from their Challenge card while not having to pay its [[Funding cost]], at the price of their opponents also getting the chance to fulfill the Challenge for free.

- A challenge deployed as a free contest cannot stay on the battlefield; it must resolve immediately. When a player announces a free contest challenge, the main phase of their turn is interrupted to complete the challenge right away.

- First, the active player attempts to complete the challenge and resolve its effects. They then pass the opportunity to the next opponent, whether they succeeded the challenge or not. All players in turn order get one chance to fulfill the challenge and its effects. After all players have taken their chance, the challenge card is sent to the owner’s discard pile.
