Agendas are a complex card type that directly help advance the player's Narrative Score.

 > [!note] [[Funding Cost]]  
 > Agendas cost [[4F]] to deploy.

 > [!tldr] An Agenda card enters play in its controller's Think Thank area.
 
 > [!warning] A player can have only one Agenda in play at once.
 
>[!todo] Once per game, a player may use a Think Tank action called Pivot to exchange an Agenda in play with an Agenda in their Hand at no Funding cost. 
>This expends the Seated Figurehead's end-of-turn action (cannot Proselytize or Fundraise that turn).

### Agenda Cards' Passive Ability: Advance Narrative

Agenda cards directly help the player win the game, and as such can be considered a win condition (along with [[Figurehead|Figureheads]] and any Creatures with [[INT]] 8 or higher).

> [!todo] Advance Narrative
> If you control an Agenda card at the end of your turn, you may have that card [[Proselytize]] at no cost.

Given that all Agenda cards cost 4F, the no-cost Proselytize is basically wrapped in the Funding cost for the card. Most Agenda cards have additional effects when in play.

> [!warning] Note
> I'm not sure whether players can ALSO Proselytize with their Seated FIgurehead that turn (for +2 Narrative Score in same turn). That could mean that players conceivably could win from starting their turn at 3 Narrative out of 5. Remains to be seen with playtesting what's the better option. For now they can. Why not.

### Ways to Destroy an Opposing Agenda

#### Using Creatures

The opponent's [[Active Zone]] must be empty to target their Agenda.

> [!example]+ An Agenda may be sent to [[History|history]] with a single [[Discredit]] attack from the following Creatures:
>
>- Any Creatures with INT 8 or higher
>- Any Creatures of the subtypes 
> >- Figurehead
> >- Revolutionary
> >- Bad Actor
> >- Double Agent
> - Any other Creatures whose rules text or unique abilities state they may target Agendas.

#### Using Plot Twists

(as of now in the ruleset) All Plot Twist cards clear the board of any Agendas and Tactics currently in play.


### Repercussions of Losing an Agenda

Having an Agenda in play be sent to your history results in -1 Narrative Score.
