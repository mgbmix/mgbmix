Creatures are the main [[CARD TYPES/Card Type|card type]] in Mondo Megabits. Most games will revolve around deploying your creatures to outnumber and take down the opponent’s creatures. 

### Rarity-based Funding Cost

> [!warning]+ Creature cards have a variable [[Funding Cost]] depending on their [[rarity]], equal to 2 points plus half that card’s rarity level (rounded down).
>  
> [[R1]] = [[2F]]  
> [[R2]] = [[3F]]  
> [[R3]] = [[3F]]  
> [[R4]] = [[4F]]  
> [[R5]] = [[4F]]  
> [[R6]] = [[5F]]  


#### Creature [[Subtype]] 

Each creature card has a subtype, which denotes its class/role/title in-game.
Some examples of subtypes are: Footsoldier, Lackey, Nemesis, and Figurehead. 

Figureheads are the most important subtype. They’re the only Creatures who can be seated in the [[Think Tank]], and they’re necessary for using certain game mechanics once seated such as Fundraise and Proselytize.

### Creature Stats

Creature cards have a variety of stats denoting their aptitudes.
 These stats are: [[HP]], [[STR]], [[INT]], [[FYT]], [[NRG]], [[SWG]], [[PSI]]

In short, the uses of each stat:
- HP = ability to sustain damage
- STR = ability to damage HP 
- INT = ability to out-think enemies
- FYT = fighting prowess 
- NRG = energy projection, for using activated abilities 
- SWG = swag, ability to do and wear cool things 
- PSI = psychological defences
