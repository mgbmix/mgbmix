Skills are an [[Equip|equippable]] card type that [[Attach|attaches]] to Creatures in play.

 > [!warning] A Skill card enters play unattached to any other card.
 
>[!abstract] A Skill card can be attached to a valid target by paying the [[equip]] cost of [[1F]].
 
>[!warning] Skills cannot be moved from one target to another after being equipped once.

>If a Skill card provides an ability, a friendly equipped Creature may use that ability at the cost of [[1F]] and an [[NRG]]-based action that turn.

 You do not need to consider the NRG of an enemy Creature when equipped with your Skill card. The [[1F]] cost remains but the NRG factor is ignored.
  
 > [!error] When a Creature leaves play, any Skill cards that were attached to it enter the discard pile.
