Items are an [[Equip|equippable]] [[CARD TYPES/Card Type|card type]] that attaches to creatures in play.

> [!note] [[Funding Cost]]
> Items cost [[2F]] to [[deploy]].

 > [!warning] An Item card enters play unattached to any other card.
 
> [!abstract] An Item card can be attached to a valid target by paying the [[equip]] cost of [[1F]].

>[!abstract] Abilities From Items
>If an Item card provides an ability, a friendly equipped Creature may use that ability at the cost of [[1F]] and an [[NRG]]-based action that turn.
>  
> > [!Note] 
 You do not need to consider the NRG of an enemy Creature when equipped with your Item card. The [[1F]] cost remains but the NRG factor is ignored.

> [!todo] When a Creature equipped with an Item leaves play, the Item remains in play and may be equipped again. 

 >[!warning] An Item can also be forcefully unequipped if a creature's [[SWG]] stat drops below the threshold for how many items they are carrying.
 
> [!danger] If the active player has no Creatures in play at the end of their turn, there's nobody on board to defend the Items; they are looted by the masses (sent to discard pile).
