  - Plot Twists

Plot Twists are a dynamic [[CARD TYPES/Card Type|card type]] that can drastically change the boardstate.

> [!note] Plot Twist [[Funding Cost]]
> Plot Twists cost [[1F]] to put into play. 

 - Plot Twists enter play face-down and in the controller’s [[Think Tank]] area.

> [!note]
> Given that they are face-down and also in the [[Think Tank]] area, Plot Twists may be combined with the player’s [[Stowed Hand]], as long as proper costs and rules are observed when each card is played.

 - When a player reveals their Plot Twist card, initiate its effects and then send it to discard. 
## Plot Twist Main Effect = Sideline Agendas and Tactics

Every Plot Twist card, upon activation will sideline all Agendas and Tactics in play for one (1) turn. 

Beyond this, Plot Twists have many other effects.
### Special Plot Twist Effects

Each Plot Twist subtype has a special effect when you activate it:

#### Paradigm Shifts = Boardwipe for [[Agenda|Agendas]] and Tactics

- When any Plot Twist card of the [[Paradigm Shift]] subtype is activated, all [[Agenda|Agendas]] and [[Tactic|Tactics]] in play are sent to discard. This effect applies to all players.

#### Bad News = All Players Send Cards From Newsfeed to History

- When any Plot Twist of the [[Bad News]] subtype is activated, each player puts the top three (3) cards of their newsfeed into their history.

#### Boobie Trap = Target Player Discards One Card

- When any Plot Twist of the [[Boobie Trap]] subtype is activated, target player discards one card from Hand (if possible).

#### Sudden Death = Chance to Lose a Creature
