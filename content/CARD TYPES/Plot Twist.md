  - Plot Twists
---
Plot Twists are a dynamic [[CARD TYPES/Card Type|card type]] that can drastically change the boardstate.

> [!note] Plot Twist [[Funding Cost]]
> Plot Twists cost [[1F]] to put into play. 

 - Plot Twists enter play face-down and in the controller’s [[Think Tank]] area.

> [!note]
> Given that they are face-down and also in the [[Think Tank]] area, Plot Twists may be combined with the player’s [[Stowed Hand]], as long as proper costs and rules are observed when each card is played.

 - When a player reveals their Plot Twist card, initiate its effects and then send it to discard. 

### Unique Plot Twist Effects

A few of the Plot Twist subtypes have special effects when you activate them:

#### Paradigm Shifts = Boardwipe for Agendas and Tactics

- When any Plot Twist card of the [[Paradigm Shift]] subtype is activated, all [[Agenda|Agendas]] and [[Tactic|Tactics]] in play are sent to discard. This effect applies to all players.

#### Bad News = All Players Discard

- When any Plot Twist of the [[Bad News]] subtype is activated, each player must discard one card for their Hand if possible.
