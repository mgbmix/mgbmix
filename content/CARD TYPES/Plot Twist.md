Plot Twists are a dynamic [[CARD TYPES/Card Type|card type]] that can drastically change the boardstate.

 - Plot Twists cost 1 Funding to put into play. 
 - Plot Twists enter play face-down and in the controller’s [[Think Tank]] area.

 - When a player reveals their Plot Twist card, initiate its effects and then send it to discard. 

 - When any Plot Twist card is activated, all Agendas and Tactics in play are sent to discard. This effect applies to all players.


   Note: Given that they are face-down and also in the [[Think Tank]] area, Plot Twists may be combined with the player’s Stowed Hand, as long as proper costs and rules are observed when each card is played.
