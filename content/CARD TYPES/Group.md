 - Group cards benefit friendly creatures only. They have no effect on opposing creatures.
 - A player’s Group card cannot be removed from play by their opponents as long as their [[Active Zone]] has at least one [[Creature]] of the group’s [[Factions|faction]] residing.
 - When a player has no Creatures of the same Faction to defend, the Group card can be removed with a single [[Discredit]] attack from a Creature with 8 [[INT]] or higher.
