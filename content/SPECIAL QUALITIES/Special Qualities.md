Cards in the game of Mondo Megabits and when played with the -mgbmix- ruleset have not only various Types and Subtypes, but they can also have other identifiers or modifiers not necessarily depicted in a categorized way.

This random assortment is termed 'Special Qualities'.

They only affect some cards, not all. Some cards have no special qualities, others have many. 

They can be temporary or permanent.

They are often checked for by other card abilities when determining effects.

Examples of Special Qualities:

- a Creature being poisoned
- a Creature being Male or Female
- a Creature being a robot
- an Item being a firearm (NOTE: 'Weapon' is an established Subtype, 'firearm' is not)
- an Item being electronic
- etc. there can be many others.

### Not always clear(?) or portrayed

Special Qualities are kind of corner cases or minor aspects of the game rules, and so they aren't always stated on each and every card they apply to. For example, not every card that is a man has 'Special Quality: Male' printed on the rules text. 

Sometimes, you might not know exactly the full list of Special Qualities or which cards they apply to. My recommendation is using the website and its rulebook pages as reference when you're not sure.
