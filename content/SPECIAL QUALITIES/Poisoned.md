Poisoned is a [[Special Qualities|special quality]] that Creatures can receive.

Generally receiving the poisoned quality is also accompanied by damage over time (occuring per turn).

BUT, the quality itself of being poisoned doesn't determine DMG amount. Each effect that applies poison will state the DMG over time *[devnote; (will it?)]*


Some cards that inflict poison:

- [[0111 - King of Dogs|King of Dogs]]
- [[0210 - Power Plant Meltdown|Power Plant Meltdown]]
- [[0059 - Research Element 151|Research Element 151]]


Some card effects change when targeting a poisoned Creature:

- [[0106 - Russian Bum Fire|Russian Bum Fire]] kills poisoned Creatures rather than damages them
