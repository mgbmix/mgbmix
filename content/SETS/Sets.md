# 'Sets' and 'Drops'

Mondo Megabits cards are released by the main development team in NFT collections called Drops. These Drops can be considered the card sets of the game. Card Set does not determine much from a gameplay standpoint. 

# Factions and Sets

Many of the Drops (and thus the Sets) are focused on one (or more) particular grouping of cards called [[Faction|Factions]]. In a loose, lore way, Factions represent different ideological collectives inside the game world. A Faction's "principles" and "ideology" don't really matter, you should just focus on the rules text in the cards and how they interact with each other. Factions have a lot more gameplay interactions than Sets, which makes them more important to a card.

# Sets and Cockatrice

When generating a cardlist, Cockatrice asks for a shorthand abbreviation for each set. I've chosen to use [[DROP01 - Fake Tech|D01]], D02, etc. as we progress through the NFT drops by the main dev team. This was my own choice and has nothing to do with the cards themselves.

# Current Sets

Currently released sets:  
[[DROP01 - Fake Tech]]  
[[DROP02 - Bum Legion 2099 & F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.3]]
