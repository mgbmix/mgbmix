Every game of -mgbmix- is played with several abstract 'Zones' that are used to organize and position different cards in play.

- [[Active Zone]], kept closest to opponent
- [[Hand]], kept closest to self (namely the [[Look Hand]] is kept there)
- [[Think Tank]], kept between Active Zone and Look Hand
- [[GAME ZONES/Location|Location]], off to the side, shared by players
- [[Detained Zone]], (working mechanic), an area for out-of-play cards

These are the four major zones of a [[Mondo Megabits]] game.
