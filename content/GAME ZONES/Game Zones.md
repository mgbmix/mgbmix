Every game of -mgbmix- is played with several abstract 'Zones' that are used to organize and position different cards in play.

- [[Active Zone]], kept closest to opponent
- [[Hand]], kept closest to self (namely the [[Look Hand]] is kept there)
- [[Think Tank]], kept between Active Zone and Look Hand
- [[GAME ZONES/Location]], off to the side, shared by players

The Active Zone, the Hand, the [[Think Tank]] area, and the Location are the four major zones of a Mondo Megabits game. Some cards and card types donâ€™t really matter where you put them on the board, so just put them off to the side somewhere when in play.**?Clarify
