The Stowed Hand is a selection of cards that a player has set aside for use on any subsequent turn. For a card to enter a player's Stowed Hand from their [[Look Hand]], that player would have to pay a [[Funding Cost]] of [[1F]] to [[Stow]] one card at a time.

> [!abstract] Stowed cards are kept face-down in the playerâ€™s [[Think Tank]] area.
