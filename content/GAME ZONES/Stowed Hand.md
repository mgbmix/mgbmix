The Stowed Hand is a selection of cards that a player has set aside for use on any subsequent turn. 

For a card to enter a player's Stowed Hand from their [[Look Hand]], that player pays a [[Funding Cost]] of [[1F]] to [[Stow]] one card. There is no maximum number of cards allowed in a player's Stowed Hand.
