The hand represents the cards a player has access to [[Deploy|deploying]] during their turn. The general 'Hand' is broken up into two very distinct subsections called the [[Look Hand]] and the [[Stowed Hand]]. 

> [!warning] It's important to understand the differences between the Look Hand and the Stowed Hand.

The [[Look Hand]] includes the cards that you get to draw at the start of your turn. These cards must be used in some way that turn (including [[Stow|Stowed]]), otherwise they are discarded.

The [[Stowed Hand]] includes all Stowed cards and can be accessed on any turn.
These cards are kept [[face-down]] in the playerâ€™s [[Think Tank]] area.
