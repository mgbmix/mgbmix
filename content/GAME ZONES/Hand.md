# Two Hands

The hand represents the cards a player has access to [[Deploy|deploying]] during their turn. The general 'Hand' is broken up into two very distinct subsections called the [[Look Hand]] and the [[Stowed Hand]]. 

> [!warning] It's important to understand the differences between the Look Hand and the Stowed Hand.

## Two Areas 

### The Look Hand 
  
The [[Look Hand]] includes the cards that you get to draw at the start of your turn. These cards must be used in some way that turn (including [[Stow|Stowed]]), otherwise they are [[Discard Pile|discarded]].  

### The Stowed Hand
  
The [[Stowed Hand]] includes all [[Stow|Stowed]] cards and can be accessed on any turn.
These cards are kept [[face-down]] in the playerâ€™s [[Think Tank]] area.  


## Board Location for Hands

Despite having two separate groups of cards called your Hand, you don't need to hold them with different hands...   
  
The Stowed Hand can be kept on the playing surface (table, etc.) in the area of your Think Tank.   
  
The Look Hand can be kept on the playing surface if you wish, as long as it's left closer to the player and clearly delineated from the Think Tank. But generally, you'll want to hold onto the cards in your Look Hand until you use them in some way, since they will go to discard at the end of turn otherwise.
