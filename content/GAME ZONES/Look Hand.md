The Look Hand includes the cards that you get to draw at the start of your turn. These cards must be used in some way that turn (including Stowed), otherwise they are discarded.

> [!abstract] Drawing a Look Hand means taking the top three cards from one's [[newsfeed]] and keeping them until the turn ends.

> [!warning] At the end of a turn, that player's remaining Look Hand is sent to their [[history]].
