Active Zone is the main area of the game for deployed Creatures & Items. 

> [!todo] All [[Creature]] and [[Item]] cards are [[Deploy|deployed]] to the Active Zone when they enter play. 

> [!abstract] Creatures can leave the Active Zone (or re-enter) depending on effects. 

## Active Zone Placement on the Board

Creatures in your Active Zone are your front-line defence. They should be placed closest to the opponent. That means, with both players putting their Active Zone closest to opponent, the Active Zones meet in the middle of the playing field.

### 'Active' descriptor

Cards in an Active Zone may be described as 'active.' For example, a card's target limitations may be for 'an active Creature.' ^f3b9ab
