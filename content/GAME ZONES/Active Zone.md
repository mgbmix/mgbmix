Active Zone

> [!todo] All [[Creature|creatures]] are [[Deploy|deployed]] to the Active Zone when they enter play. 

Creatures can leave the Active Zone (or re-enter) depending on effects. 

Creatures in your Active Zone are your front-line defence. They should be placed closest to the opponent.


Cards in an Active Zone may be described as 'active.' For example, a card's target limitations being 'an active Creature.' ^f3b9ab
