The Think Tank is one of the most important areas of an -mgbmix- game for each player.

Imagine the Think Tank as your closest and strongest allies working for your cause behind the scenes. Your Think Tank will help generate [[Funding]] for you to pay for cards and abilities, as well as further your Narrative along its path to victory. It should be kept closer to the player, behind the [[Active Zone]], but in front of their [[Look Hand]]. 

Your Think Tank area houses your [[Seat|Seated]] Figurehead, your Agenda, [[Group]], face-down [[Plot Twist]], and [[Tactic|Tactics]] cards, as well as any cards kept in the [[Stowed Hand]].

Depending on the build of your deck, you may have more cards in your Think Tank area than your Active Zone, so leave enough room for all your cards.
