The Think Tank is one of the most important areas of an -mgbmix- game for each player.   
Imagine the Think Tank as your closest and strongest allies working for your cause behind the scenes. 

Your Think Tank will help generate [[Funding]] for you to pay for cards and abilities, as well as further your [[Narrative Score]] along its path to victory. It should be kept closer to the player, behind the [[Active Zone]], but in front of the [[Look Hand]]. 

Your Think Tank area houses your [[Seat|Seated]] Figurehead, your Agenda, [[Group]], face-down [[Plot Twist]], and [[Tactic|Tactics]] cards, as well as any cards kept in the [[Stowed Hand]]. There are also occasions where a card may become [[Attach|attached]] to one's Think Tank.

Depending on the build of your deck, you may have more cards in your Think Tank area than your Active Zone, so leave enough room for all your cards.
