The Think Tank is one of the most important areas of an -mgbmix- game for each player.   
Imagine the Think Tank as your closest and strongest allies working for your cause behind the scenes.   


## Think Tank Placement on the Board  

A player's Think Tank area should be kept closer to the player, behind the [[Active Zone]], but in front of the [[Look Hand]].  It's in the middle of the area belonging to a single player.


## Members of the Think Tank  

Your Think Tank area houses many different cards including your [[Seat|Seated]] Figurehead, your Agenda, [[Group]], face-down [[Plot Twist]], and [[Tactic|Tactics]] cards, as well as any cards kept in the [[Stowed Hand]]. There are also occasions where a card may become [[Attach|attached]] to one's Think Tank.  

> [!warning] Depending on the build of your deck, you may have more cards in your Think Tank area than your Active Zone, so leave enough room for all your cards.

## [[Think Tank Actions]]  

Your Think Tank will help generate [[Funding]] for you to pay for cards and abilities, as well as further your [[Narrative Score]] along its path to victory. These actions require a [[Seat|Seated]] [[Figurehead]] and are called [[Fundraise]] and [[Proselytize]].
