# itch.io release

The main [[Mondo Megabits]] dev team also released an official software to interact with the cards. 

It's available for download at https://mondomegabits.itch.io/mondo-megabits  
It's developed by Wesley Moses or wes337  
https://github.com/wes337  

Some negatives that dissuaded me from using it for my ruleset project:  
  
- I can't get it to run on my Linux distro  
- It costs 15 dollars (for non NFT holders, the vast majority of potential playtesters)  
- It doesn't include my custom updated rules, mechanics, and card text  
  
That being said, I did heavily rely on the github repository of that same dev's Mondo web app in order to collect images and text relating to Drop01 for use in Cockatrice, so thanks very much to wes for providing such material online.  

## Sidenote: Web App

As of the last time I checked, wes' app was still tryable in a web browser at this location:
