Interested in playtesting -mgbmix-? 

Make sure you have Cockatrice installed and that you're familiar with the style of game and the kind of ruleset being created.

# Software Options

I definitely think Cockatrice is the best for the current state of the project, but for completeness, here's are the options where Mondo Megabits could conceivably be playtested at the moments.

- [[Cockatrice]]
- [[Tabletop Simulator]]
- [[Official itch.io Release]]



### Cockatrice Installation

### Scope of Ruleset

- [[Design Space]]

### Understanding the Ruleset

Having a good understanding of [[MtG|Magic: the Gathering]] rules, especially at a Rules Advisor level or better, would be an incredible asset to help form this ruleset. People who have no mtg experience can still contribute to the project of course, however previous card game experience is always good.
