Interested in playtesting -mgbmix-? 

# Software Options

I definitely think Cockatrice is the best for the current state of the project, but for completeness, here's are the options where Mondo Megabits could conceivably be playtested at the moment. Cockatrice is the only option that I have for updating the card rules on a regular basis.

- [[Cockatrice]]
- [[Tabletop Simulator]]
- [[Official Release]]

## Cockatrice Installation

# Scope of Ruleset

- [[Design Space]]
- [[Game Concepts]]

## Understanding the Ruleset

Having a good understanding of [[MtG|Magic: the Gathering]] rules, especially at a Rules Advisor level or better, would be an incredible asset to help form this ruleset. People who have no mtg experience can still contribute to the project of course, however previous card game experience is always good.
