# Starting the Game

## Initial Deployment

The first turn of the game for each player is their Initial Deployment.

> [!note] Initial Funding
> Each player receives 20 Funding at the start of their Initial Deployment.

## Initial Deployment Hands

> [!note] Initial Hand
> At the start of the game, all players draw an Initial Deployment hand of seven cards.

> [!warning] First Player Skips First Look
> The first player to take a turn skips the three-card Look Hand they would normally receive. This does not affect any other player. This means that on the first turn, Player 1 sees seven cards total, while other players would see ten total (Initial Hand plus Look Hand for their Turn 1).






An example of a game's proceedings.

Player 1 receives 20 Funding and draws seven cards.
That player may then deploy and use any cards for their Funding cost, or Stow any cards for 1 Funding each. That player may Seat a Figurehead (if one was played), and if Seated take a Think Tank action of Fundraise or Proselytize.

Player 2 receives 20 Funding and draws a Look Hand of ten cards.
That player may then deploy and use any cards for their Funding cost, or Stow any cards for 1 Funding each. That player may Seat a Figurehead (if one was played), and if Seated take a Think Tank action of Fundraise or Proselytize. 

Play now continues with players taking regular turns that start by gaining 4 Funding and drawing a Look Hand of three cards. 

The following is an example boardstate after Player 1 draws their seven cards and deploys them all to board. Above each card is its Funding cost, below is its rarity or type.

Note that the player chose to Proselytize at the end of their turn, gaining an extra 2 Funding since their Seated Figurehead had 5 INT.
