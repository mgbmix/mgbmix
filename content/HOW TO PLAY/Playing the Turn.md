Most of the actions a player takes during their turn can be taken at any point. However, some procedures happen at the start or end of a turn no matter what.

START OF TURN
 - All previously activated or used cards in play become refreshed/untapped.
 - Active player draws the [[Look Hand]]. (exception: Player 1 Turn 1)
 - [[Think Tank]] adds [[Funding]] to active player’s coffers. 20 points via Initial Funding, 4 Funding normally.

From this point on, the player is free to make decisions and perform actions, such as:
 - [[Stow]] cards from Look Hand to Stowed Hand (1 Funding each)
 - [[Deploy]] cards from Look Hand or Stowed Hand for their respective [[Funding cost]]
 - Attack with creatures using [[STR]] attacks or [[INT]] attacks (if possible)
 - Use abilities and effects (from Creatures, Items, Skills, Groups, Tactics, etc.)
 - Use Think Tank to Seat or Unseat a Figurehead Creature

END OF TURN
 - If Think Tank has an available Figurehead, then [[Fundraise]] or [[Proselytize]].
 - Any cards from the Look Hand that weren’t used are sent to the discard pile.
 - Turn count increases by one; effects that reach their turn limit end before next turn.
