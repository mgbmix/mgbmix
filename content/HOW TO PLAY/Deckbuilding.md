Limits and Tips

## Requirements

> [!warning]+ An -mgbmix- deck <u>must</u> meet the following constraints:
> - Minimum 40 cards total in the deck  
> - Maximum 3x any one card in the deck  


## Suggestions

> [!note] 
> While it is recommended to devote a portion of your deck to the [[Figurehead]] [[subtype]] of [[Creature]] (for their increased utility and abilities), a deck is not required to include any Figureheads if the player doesnâ€™t want to. 

> [!warning] 
>  While the above is technically true, as of now it would be very difficult to win a game without any Creatures in the deck, especially when omitting both Figureheads and high [[INT]] Creatures. This game is largely based around Creature presence on the board, so you are encouraged to use them when building your first decks.
