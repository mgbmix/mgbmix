Rules Text:  

This Skill equips for a [[1F]] cost to an opposing Active Zone.  
Once equipped, this Skill cannot be moved.  
When the attached Active Zone's player loses, send this card to discard.  

[UNSUPERVISED] For the rest of this turn, electric/electro attacks and hacking you perform against targets in the attached Active Zone may be done twice; once normally and once clandestine.   
You may choose new targets for the clandestine attacks, and they cannot be blocked or avoided.
