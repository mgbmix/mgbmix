Rules Text:  

This Skill equips for a [[1F]] cost to an opposing Creature.  
Once equipped, this Skill cannot be moved to another Creature.  
When the attached Creature leaves play, send this card to discard.  

Stealth Warps deliver a small EMP upon activation, disabling comms and surveillance. This Skill may be attached to any opposing Creature regardless of protection or targeting limitations.  

[Stealth Warp] An otherwise unattackable card (shielded, in hiding, in a bunker, in witness protection, etc.--and even: divine, ephemeral, time-paradoxical, non-existent, traveling at light speed, and so on (i.e., for any reason)) can now be attacked once, 
with a 4X crit DMG buff.
