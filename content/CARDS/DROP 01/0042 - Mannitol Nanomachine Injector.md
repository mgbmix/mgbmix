Rules Text:  

This Item equips for a 1F cost to a Creature card you control.  

/MANN-I-TOTALED/ Equipped creature takes damage as usual but also stores that damage in the balls as Nuts DMG. Keep track of your creature's Nuts DMG.  

[MANNITOL RELEASE] Equipped creature releases all stored Nuts DMG and deals it to target creature an opponent controls.
Equipped creature cannot fire back DMG if it has stored a lethal amount of damage (compared to maximum HP). Destroy the equipped creature.
