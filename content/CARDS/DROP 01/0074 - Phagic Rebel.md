Rules Text:  

This Item equips for a [[1F]] cost to a Creature card you control.  

[Free Harvey Oswald] Fire the Phagic Rebel at a biological creature;  
On next turn: affected creature has a chance to remove poison if they have a healer ally/poison removal item/PrEP;  
One turn later: creature loses eyesight (flip a coin to land attacks);  
After final (hospice) turn: creature drops dead of Dyna-AIDS.  

[Unlikely Restock] If you have a BRICS creature in play, you can buy another bullet for 200 HP (any friendly creature may make the sacrifice).
