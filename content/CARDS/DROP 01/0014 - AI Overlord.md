Rules Text:  

[[HP]]: 675 [[STR]]: 1 [[INT]]: 9 [[FYT]]: 1 [[NRG]]: 9 [[SWG]]: 4 [[PSI]]: 3  

[Mild Resentment] Discard one (1) card from your hand, then resurrect any discarded robot cards OR take control of opponent's robot cards.  

[Maximal Suffering] Target creature takes 175 DMG.  

/Mild Resentment v2.0/ Once a player plays AI Overlord, no other player may do so.  

[Quantum Predictive Analysis] Any move the opponent makes this turn, say "I predicted you'd do that so I already installed the perfect countermeasures." They cannot do any of their moves. Quexnert's CPU explodes when this is complete--remove AI Overlord from play.
