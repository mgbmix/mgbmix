Rules Text:  

This Skill equips for a [[1F]] cost to an active Creature you control.  
Once equipped, this Skill cannot be moved to another Creature.  
When the attached Creature leaves play, send this card to discard.  

/Double Warp/ When this card is attached to a creature, search your deck for two (2) copies of the same Creature card, reveal them, and put them into your Stowed Hand.  
If you cannot find two (2) copies of the card, this effect does nothing.
