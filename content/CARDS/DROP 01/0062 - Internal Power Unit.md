Rules Text:  

This Item equips for a [[1F]] cost to a biological/humanoid Creature card you control.  

/Invasive Implant/ This Item cannot be moved to another creature once equipped.  
    
/Guaranteed Cancer/ Equipped creature dies after 30 turns.
But it's worth it cuz they can wallrun and do flips.  

[Stark... Tony Stark] Must kick-start the nuclear engine- do 100 crunches and wait one (1) turn. This must be done before you can utilize the buffs.
Increase STR to 8;  
Increase DMG dealt by 200;  
Susceptible to EMP and electric attacks--creature becomes 'robot' type.
Weak Point: Any firearm critical hits cause instant death- BOOM!
