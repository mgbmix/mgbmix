Rules Text:  

[Liftoff] As soon as this card is drawn, the controller may put it into play. If they do, all cards with odd-numbered [[rarity]] rankings get launched into space (destroyed).   
Each player may draw half of the number of cards lost. All players draw new cards. You wanted this. This is good.  
View enemy's newly drawn hand - choose two (2) cards to remove.  

[False Hope Hoax] Planet B is actually a projection on a giant dinner plate floating in space. There is no liftoff.
