Rules Text:  

This Skill equips for a [[1F]] cost to your [[Think Tank]].  
Once equipped, this Skill cannot be moved.  

/Selective Warp/ When you equip this card, search your deck for one (1) card, reveal it, then place it back into your deck and shuffle.   
At any point in the game, you may sacrifice an Item card to retrieve your previously selected (teleported) card and move it to your Stowed Hand.  

/Defective Warp/ If this card is used while enemy has a Tantillo Systems creature in play, your teleport app is hacked, compromising your warp and leaving your atoms shredded and spliced with roach DNA.
Instant death to a creature of enemy's choice.
