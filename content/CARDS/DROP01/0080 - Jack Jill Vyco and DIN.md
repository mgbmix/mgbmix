# Rules Text  

[[HP]]: 1500 [[STR]]: 0 [[INT]]: 20 [[FYT]]: 0 [[NRG]]: 10 [[SWG]]: 12 [[PSI]]: 0  

/Bicameral_Mind/ When you play this card, it becomes two (2) creatures. You may use toilet paper and coins if you do not have multiple copies of this card and/or official Mondo Megabits stat tokens (they look like red and blue jellybeans-you should have some in your starter pack SWAG SABRESTACHE). Stack coins on top of toilet paper to represent stats. Each piece of toilet paper gets exactly half the stats shown on this card.  

/Lost in the Sauce/ When either Vyco (Jack) OR [D.I.N.] (Jill) uses a [[Drug]] item, they both enjoy the effects, and for double (2x) the duration.  

/Jack In, Plug Out/ If Vyco (Jack) and [D.I.N.] (Jill) do not both consume a [[Drug]] Item at least once every (5) turns, destroy them.  

[Bad, Together] Copper wire theft attack.  
300 DMG if both Vyco (Jack) and [D.I.N.] (Jill) are still alive.
