# Rules Text  

This Skill [[Equip|equips]] for a [[1F]] cost to an active [[Creature]] you control.  
Once equipped, this Skill cannot be moved to another Creature.  
When the attached Creature leaves play, send this card to discard.  

/I Hold the Keys/ Any teleportation moves/pranks are foiled by your omniscient failsafe.   
Whenever an enemy creature attempts a warp, equipped creature deals 200 [[DMG]] to that creature and the effect of the warp fails.  

[What I Now Know] Any creatures who have teleported in the last five (5) turns have their dox dropped on PortalForums, leading to intense paranoia and reluctance to teleport again in the future. Incredible psychological debuff.  
-4 [[PSI]] 
-50 Max HP  
Those creatures can no longer attack Tantillo Systems creatures.
