# Rules Text  

[[HP]]: 300 [[STR]]: 4 [[INT]]: 3 [[FYT]]: 2 [[NRG]]: 3 [[SWG]]: 1 [[PSI]]: 4  

/Strange Glitch/ Roborg can only use each ability once until all three have been used, then they refresh at the end of that turn.  

[Security Protocol C: Terminate] Roborg the Robot Cyborg identifies a threat and attacks.  
200 [[DMG]]. Electric shock attack. 2X [[DMG]] vs robot creatures.  

[Electric Shield: Deploy] Roborg deploys an impenetrable shield for himself and his two buddies.  
Nothing comes in or out, attack-wise, for two (2) turns;
Enemies who attempt to melee attack a shielded creature take 200 [[DMG]], big mistake.  

[Listen To Me I'm Still Ryan] It's only a glitch. Still creepy though.  
Stun yourself for one (1) turn.
