# Rules Text  

This Tactic enters play face-up in your [[Think Tank]]. You may activate its effect at any time.  
After using its effect, send this card to your history.  

[Reversomorphification] Flip a coin.  
Heads: You get a buff that says "The next [[Discredit]] attack against your narrative fails. This buff is destroyed immediately after." OR you may reduce your opponent's [[Narrative Score|narrative]] by one (1). This is a forced effect and not a Discredit attack itself.  
Tails: Both players put back one card from their [[Stowed Hand]], shuffle.
