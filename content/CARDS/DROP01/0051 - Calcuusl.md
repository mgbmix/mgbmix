# Rules Text  

This Skill [[Equip|equips]] for a [[1F]] cost to a [[Figurehead]] you control.
Once equipped, this Skill cannot be moved to another Creature.
When the attached Creature leaves play, send this card to discard.  

[Number Flubber] Use advanced magi-matic Aljebra and Calcuusl to rig the numbers in your favor.  
Convince your foes that they counted wrong: reduce all DMG dealt to your creatures by 100 for the next three (3) turns; you may activate this once.
Dispose of this card after the three (3) turns have passed. There is now a new math: Cralaclus.
