This Skill [[Equip|equips]] for a [[1F]] cost to a target.  
Once equipped, this Skill cannot be moved to another target.  
When the attached target leaves play, send this card to discard.  

Annoying Shit: 
As long as this card remains equipped, whenever an opponent draws a card, flip a coin.
If heads, that player's Seated Figurehead takes 25 threat DMG.
