# Rules Text

If you control this card at the end of your turn, this card performs your turn's Proselytize at no cost.

/Good Mind Games/ 
five (5) turns after Targeted Individual Database is put into play, 
all enemy creature cards fall victim to a twisted government mental harassment scheme (or so they want to think)
- Enemy creatures currently in play are now Gangstalked
- Gangstalked debuff Reduces STR and PSI by half (¬Ω) of their original values. Round up if necessary

/My Good Reality/ 
Thanks to the Targeted Individual Database, 
all friendly creatures currently suffering from the Gangstalked debuff are now instead endowed with the Goodstalked buff.
- Your best friends are watching you perform-uplifting +2 boost to STR
