[The Clean-Up] 
Deals 625 DMG to all Gross Shift and BRICS creatures on the field.

[Weaponized Problem Solving] 
D6 roll:
- D1-2 Black Male/Mail: Costs one (1) turn. Invite an enemy creature to a party with
"pizza," "hotdogs," and "walnut sauce."  Enemy creature can no longer attack you, 
due to some compromising photos of them and Kevin Spacey which must never be made public.
- D3-4 False (Black) Flag: Fabricate a terror attack, distracting all enemy creature cards
for one (1) turn (equivalent to 20 years in realtime). Never forget this terror attack. If either  player forgets the attack, they forfeit the game.
- D5-6 Legalize Something: "If they continue to X while my Y citizens suffer, we WILL
give them street signs!"  
Legalize something (anything) totally because it's a good idea 
  and not a cheap reparation to a group of whiners who are probably deaf! +5 SWG
