# Rules Text  

When you activate this card, send all Agendas and [[Tactic|Tactics]] in play to the discard. This effect applies to all players.  

Just As Planned: 
Choose any opponent-controlled creature. 
That creature murders the creature next to it, and one (1) randomly selected creature you control, 
- Place a Gun Control counter on all of your opponent's creatures. 
A creature suffering from the Gun Control debuff cannot attack with projectile weapons 
(even if majicka-based or otherwise clearly not involving a gun);
- Opponent may pay two (2) Funding Points to purchase black market weapons (all Gun Control counters removed).
