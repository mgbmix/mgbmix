[Create New Account] 
This location card allows you up to two (2) creature conversions to F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.¬≥ faction, allowing creatures to join the agency and benefit from faction specific buffs- 

/Agent e-Portal/
When this card enters play, you may target an active F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.¬≥ creature you control.
If you do, that creature's owner puts it on the bottom of their deck. That player shuffles their newsfeed.
Then you may search your newsfeed for a F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.¬≥ creature and deploy it at no cost. Shuffle your newsfeed after.
