# Rules Text  

This Buff enters play attached to an active Creature card..  
When the buffed Creature leaves play, send this card to discard.  

[Tweaked] Just a puff.
The buffed creature may now attack twice in one turn, for two (2) turns. When the effect ends, this card stays in play (addicted). 
But: (slight drawback!) 
whenever buffed creature attacks, roll two(2) six-sided dice.
  On snake eyes: you must sacrifice an Item card you control.
