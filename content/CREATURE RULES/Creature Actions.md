# Actions...Done by Creatures

'Creature Actions' refers to a loose collection of things that any Creature card is capable of doing.

## Two Major Actions

### Attacking (Two Forms)
#### STR-based Physical Attacks

A Creature may attack enemy Creatures with a Physical Attack to deal DMG to that Creature's HP stat. A Physical Attack is calculated by the attacker's STR stat multiplied by 100 to get the resulting DMG.

#### INT-based Discredit Attacks

A Creature may attack enemy concepts such as Groups, Agendas, and Narratives with a Discredit Attack, as long as that Creature meets certain criteria. Not all Creatures can perform Discredit attacks.

#### Number of Attacks Dictated by FYT stat

Both forms of attacking are considered by the FYT stat of a Creature. High FYT means more possible attacks in a single turn, whether they are Physical or Discredit depends on the Creature.


### Using Abilities (Creature Abilities)

#### Creature Abilities = Appearing on the Card
A Creature's natural abilities are those that it has on its own card.  
These abilities are used with energy and are considered by the NRG stat of a Creature. High NRG means more possible ability activations in a single turn. 

> [!warning] This applies <u>only</u> to Creature Abilities and not the abilities of equipped Items or Skills. 
> Equipped abilities from Items or Skills are used by paying a [[Funding Cost]] of [[1F]].
