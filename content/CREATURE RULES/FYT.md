FYT = fighting prowess 
   - FYT 5 or higher = two attacks per turn. 
   - FYT 10 or higher = three attacks per turn. 

An attack may be [[STR]] based Physical Attack or [[INT]] based Discredit Attack (if possible). 

With multiple attacks, the Creature may target the same or new enemy Creatures.

### FYT and [[NRG]]

These two stats are similar in that they affect how many times a Creature can perform an action in one turn.

FYT for Attacking actions - Physical Attacks or Discredit Attacks

[[NRG]] for Ability actions - Activated abilities in a Creature's card frame cost NRG to use. 

Note: Whereas with activated abilities given by a Skill or Item, those such abilities are used by paying Funding.
