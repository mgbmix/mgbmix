NRG = energy projection, for using abilities 
   - NRG 5 or higher = two abilities per turn. 
   - NRG 10 or higher = three abilities per turn. 
Creatures cannot use the same ability multiple times per turn. NRG stat also accounts for using an equipped Item ability or Skill ability. In other words, a Creature with 6 NRG and a Skill card may use one of its own abilities plus a Skill ability equipped to it, or two of its own abilities.
