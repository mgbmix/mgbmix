NRG = energy projection, for using abilities 
   - NRG 5 or higher = two abilities per turn. 
   - NRG 10 or higher = three abilities per turn. 
Creatures cannot use the same ability multiple times per turn. NRG stat also accounts for using an equipped Item ability or Skill ability. In other words, a Creature with 6 NRG and a Skill card may use one of its own abilities plus a Skill ability equipped to it, or two of its own abilities.


### [[FYT]] and NRG

These two stats are similar in that they affect how many times a Creature can perform an action in one turn.

[[FYT]] for Attacking actions - Physical Attacks or Discredit Attacks

NRG for Ability actions - Activated abilities in a Creature's card frame cost NRG to use. 

Note: Whereas with activated abilities given by a Skill or Item, those such abilities are used by paying Funding.
