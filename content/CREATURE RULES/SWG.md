SWG = swag, ability to do and wear cool things 
SWG stat has two functions: multiple actions and item equip load. 
   - Multi-Act: SWG 5 or higher = creature may use Attack and Ability actions in the same turn. Number of actions depends on FYT and NRG.
   - Equip Load: SWG 1-3 = 1 Item. SWG 4-6 = 2 Items. SWG 7-9 = 3 Items. SWG 10 or higher = no limit to equipped Items.
