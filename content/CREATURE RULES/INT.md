INT = ability to out-think enemies

> [!abstract] Smart Creatures can attack the opposing Narrative and Groups. 
   INT 8 or higher = creature may perform a [[Discredit]] attack. Creatures affected by [[summoning sickness]] cannot Discredit.

> [!help] Some effects can only target vulnerable Creatures with low INT. 

### INT stat - even more important for Figureheads

You should pay closer attention to the INT stat on your [[Figurehead]] [[Creature|Creatures]], since they are able to use the [[Fundraise]] action if [[Seat|seated]], which awards [[Funding]] to the player depending on the INT value of that seated creature.
