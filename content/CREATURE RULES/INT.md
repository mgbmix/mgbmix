INT = ability to out-think enemies


## High INT = Discredit Attacks

> [!abstract] Smart Creatures can attack the opposing Narrative and Groups. 
   INT 8 or higher = creature may perform a [[Discredit]] attack. Creatures affected by [[Summoning Sickness|summoning sickness]] cannot Discredit.

## High INT = Protects Against Some Targeted Effects

> [!help] Some effects can only target vulnerable Creatures with low INT. 
> Example: [[0087 - Panopticon You|Panopticon You]] which has the rules text:
> > This Skill [[Equip|equips]] for a [[1F]] cost to an opposing active [[Creature]] with [[INT]] below 7.

## INT stat - even more important for Figureheads

You should pay closer attention to the INT stat on your [[Figurehead]] [[Creature|Creatures]], since they are able to use the [[Fundraise]] action if [[Seat|seated]], which awards [[Funding]] to the player depending on the INT value of that seated creature.
