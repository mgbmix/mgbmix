Face-down is a state that cards may enter in a game of -mgbmix-.

A face-down card is flipped over so that the identifying cardface is covered and only the cardback identical, to all cards, is seen.

Face-down cards can represent hidden information during a game. 

Common ways for cards to be face-down in play:

- Cards [[Stow|Stowed]] to the [[Stowed Hand]] are face-down in the [[Think Tank]]
- [[Plot Twist|Plot Twists]] (also in the Stowed Hand) are [[Deploy|deployed]] face-down and ready to activate
