a.k.a. Damage

# Standardized Notation

> [!todo] Any time in the game that damage is dealt to a [[Creature]], the amount will be denoted by a number followed by the letters DMG after a space.

#### Damage Modifiers

Damage amounts are sometimes altered from what the original effect stated. This can be the result of an effect in play for the turn or a passive ability belonging to a card.

> [!abstract] Example
> [[0044 - The Living House|The Living House]] gives a damage modifier to [[Fake Tech]] Creatures for 5 turns

##### Damage Type

Sometimes damage is given a specific type. These can potentially lead to modified amount of that damage if the recipient has a weakness or resistance to that type.
