Player is the default term for anyone who is actively engaged in the Mondo Megabits game in question.

Each player has their own deck of cards to play with during a game.

Each player starts with a [[Narrative Score]] of 0.

In lore, the player is also referred to as The Puppet-Master (or one of many competing puppetmasters). 

In all -mgxmix- rules text, things relating to players will keep the default term.
