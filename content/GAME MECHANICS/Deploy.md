To deploy a card in -mgbmix- means to bring it into play. 

The following are several rules to keep in mind about deploying.

- To deploy a card from one's [[Hand]] usually requires paying its [[Funding Cost]], however there may be times when rules text reads "You may deploy this card without paying its funding cost..." One example of this is playing a [[Challenge]] card in [[Challenge#Free Contest Challenges|Free Contest]] mode.

- A card may be deployed from elsewhere than one's [[Hand]], such as if it was temporarily removed from play, or if it enters play from another area such as the [[history]] or the [[newsfeed]]. **In these cases, the funding cost is ignored.**

'Deploy' can be considered the equivalent to 'cast' in [[MtG]] parlance, though the two are not identical in their details.
