# Faction = Memetic Allegiance

In a loose, lore way, Factions represent different ideological collectives inside the game world. A Faction's "principles" and "ideology" don't really matter, you should just focus on the rules text in the cards and how they interact with each other.


# List of Factions

[[Fake Tech]]  
[[FEMACUBEÂ³]]
[[Bum Legion 2099]]  

# Groups Subtype

> [!note]
> '[[Faction(subtype)\|Faction]]' is also a subtype of the [[Group]] card type.
