Rarity is a symbol to show the card's artificial value or scarcity. 

A card can be assigned one of six possible values for its Rarity. These are denoted by an uppercase R followed by a number without a space between them. Such as: [[R1]], [[R2]], [[R3]], [[R4]], [[R5]], [[R6]].


### Rarity-based Funding Costs

Some card types have [[Funding Cost|Funding Costs]] that vary depending on the card's rarity. 
The card types that follow this rule are [[Creature|Creatures]] and [[Challenge|Challenges]].
The cost in each case equals to 2F plus half that cardâ€™s rarity level (rounded down). Given that formula, the minimum cost is 2F and the maximum is 5F, with some duplicates due to rounding.

R1 = 2F  
R2 = 3F  
R3 = 3F  
R4 = 4F  
R5 = 4F  
R6 = 5F  



Some cards have rules and effects that check a card's rarity, so it is an active quality for cards from a gameplay standpoint.
