Every card in Mondo Megabits will have the following elements. 

[[Name]]  
[[Faction Marker]]  
[[Text Box]]  
[[Card Type]]  
[[Subtype]]  
[[Rarity]]  
[[Collector Number]]  


> [!example] Cards of the [[Creature]] type also have these elements.
> 
> A stat line containing seven creature stats: [[HP]], [[STR]], [[INT]], [[FYT]], [[NRG]], [[SWG]], [[PSI]]


> [!help] Note
> A card's [[Sets|Set]] is not necessarily portrayed on a card, however it can be inferred by which [[Faction]] the card belongs to. E.g. All [[Fake Tech]] cards come from [[DROP01 - Fake Tech|Drop01]], thus a Fake Tech card such as [[0066 - TIA Wave Projector|TIA Wave Projector]] is known to be from the Set D01.
