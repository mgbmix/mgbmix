I devised this ruleset with the following core concepts:

- Have a playable game with only the first set’s ([[Fake Tech]]) cards.
- Keep everything “by the numbers” so that people can enjoy the schizophrenic dystopian cards without the lore-rules arguments.
- Keep as much of the developer’s original rules and mechanics intact.
- Offer additional rule tweaks and modifications that further add choice and strategy.
