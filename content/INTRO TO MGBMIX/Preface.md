### [[Mondo Megabits]] is <u>not</u> a card game

It is certainly a NFT project. It’s also a funny comedy project and a satire of society and trading card games. But the devs have not provided anything close to a playable game yet. At most, it could be considered an “anti-game.” Hard to read cards loaded with mechanics and game concepts that work against the players as they try to enjoy the game. 

It reminds me of a TCG equivalent to the notorious “anti-games” of videogames, such as the 1986 Japanese game Takeshi’s Challenge, or the originally unreleased but still infamous Penn and Teller’s Desert Bus. Gameplay experiences that were designed to maliciously interact with the player.  

### [[index|-mgbmix-]] <u>is</u> a card game

I love Mondo Megabits. I also want to play Mondo Megabits. My project attempts to create a relatively approachable ruleset for play with Mondo Megabits cards. 

These rules are nowhere perfect, but they’re a working foundation that I’m going to continue improving as a personal project, regardless of the playability or finished state of the official game. I hope many people try their hands at making fun rules out of this insanity.
