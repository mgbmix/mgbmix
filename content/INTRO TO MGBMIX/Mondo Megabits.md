Mondo Megabits is an NFT project headed by Sam Hyde and Jet Neptune. It is a multimedia comedy project depicting a satire of modern society framed in a pseudo-fictional card game. Each item released by the main development team represents a card from this fictional game.


The goal of the -mgxmix- project is to bring this fictional half-game into reality by fully developing its ruleset and card text. (-mgbmix- is unaffiliated with the main Mondo Megabits dev team)
