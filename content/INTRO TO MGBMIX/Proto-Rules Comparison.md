# The Video

The following is a video of the preliminary draft of a ruleset devised by the main team releasing the NFTs. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x4UsERerCS4?si=hg8t8cTQxMk_F0FK&amp;start=75" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A lot of things don't make sense in this vid, but it offered me enough of an initial vision from the creators to get a feel for the game they wanted while I filled in some gaps.

This explanation is very long-winded. I <u>do not</u> recommend reading this to understand the rules. It's for people who want to see exactly what I took from Sam's rules and what I didn't.

This comparison was written around the time of version [[0.5]] or [[0.6]] of my ruleset. If a lot of time or versions have passed, there could be notable differences in the rules by now.

# The Comparison

## Intro
After watching the video again, I've compiled a report of what elements are kept basically the same and which are changed. This content is for people who are curious about how I adapted the first "rules" released by the main team.

## Differences in rules from Sam's video
### Narrative formation

in sam's vid:  
> To form your narrative, simply combine an agenda (any subtype), a figurehead, and an incantation. You now have a narrative.

in -mgbmix-:  
'Narrative' is only linked to each person's Narrative Score (deciding factor of the game, the 'finish line'). Most often, a player will need a Figurehead in play to increase their Narrative Score, so you could say that only a figurehead is needed and not the other two card types. 

> [!note] NOTE as well: 
> Agenda and Incantation cards did not exist in DROP01 when I made the first version of my rules, so I could not include them. Those cards will somehow help the player gain narrative, but I'm not sure how yet...

### Weird Shit

in sam's vid:  
>These cards sit closest to the player and remain on the board throughout play. Their effects can be triggered at any time, including to interrupt enemy play. After triggered, they are tapped but not discarded. Unlike regular cards in the player's hand, they do not untap at the beginning of the next turn, instead they must be FUNDED to untap. More on this later.

in -mgbmix-:  
Forget that entire paragraph it doesn't make any sense. I will instead make a few statements about my ruleset as it stands.  

- There is a [[Game Zones|zone]] called the [[Think Tank]] that sits closer to the player. One [[Figurehead]] [[Creature]], and many other [[CARD TYPES/Card Type|card types]], exist in that area when in play.
- Most effects in the game <u>cannot</u> be triggered at any time. Some can.
- Cards do often get tapped when used. Most of those cards will untap at beginning of the controller's turn. Some will stay tapped until conditions are met. I have no idea what Sam means about cards in the player's hand untapping...

### Narrative Counter

> [!success] All the same. It's the same end-goal to the game.

### "Discredit, Disown, Disenfranchise"

in sam's video:  
> the entire slide called "Discredit, Disown, Disenfranchise"

in -mgbmix-:  
Discrediting has been expanded in a number of ways:  
 - creatures must have 8 INT or higher to perform a discredit attack
 - An area of play called the Active Zone must be clear of the opponent's creatures before discredit attack can be done  
 - When opponent has a Seated Figurehead, only 1 discredit attack per turn
 - No figurehead in think tank = unlimited discredit attacks by able creatures

> [!fail] The 'Buffer Zone' area hasn't been implemented in my rules. At the moment I don't want it. There's other ways that can defend from attacks.

I haven't seen any Plot Twists that change Narrative Score, but in my rules they are one of the card types that can be activated at any time, so that remains true.  

### Increasing Narrative

in sam's video:  
> To empower your own Narrative by ONE POINT, you must spend ten (10) funding points AT ONCE!

in -mgbmix-:  
Increasing your own Narrative Score is called Proselytizing. It costs [[4F]] instead of 10. You must use your Seated Figurehead that turn to [[Proselytize]].

### Intersectionality
> [!success] Doesn't change. All cards can be used and mixed together.

> [!abstract] BUT, in my rules it is still possible to play with only one faction e.g. just Drop01 [[Fake Tech]] cards.

### Funding
For now, much of the funding costs are the same, though there are some differences.  

> [!success] [[Funding]] rates are the same, 4 per turn and 20 max.

> [!abstract] BUT, you can also do an ability called "[[Fundraise]]" to gain more Funding at end of their turn. This requires a Seated Figurehead.


### The Deck, The Hand, the Discard

in sam's video:  
> the slide called "The Deck, The Hand, the Discard"

in -mgbmix-:  
The player still looks at three cards per turn. They cannot go back to the top of the library. If they are not used in the turn, they are sent to discard.  
  
It is possible to save them for later by spending [[1F]] to [[Stow]] a card. Stowed cards are kept in a long-term hand that can be accessed on later turns.  
  
Sam mentions the discard pile gets reused when draw pile is emptied. I can work with that, however I think the possibility of "empty draw pile means game over" is interesting as that offers a unique win condition. Fow now, the rules can stay as-is.  

### The Board

in sam's video:  
> section called "The Board"  

in -mgbmix-:  
> [!fail] No Buffer Zone, so that whole slide is irrelevant.

### Factions
> [!success] Same stuff, unchanged. it just talks about using and mixing factions

### Creatures
> [!success] Everything here is kept as-is.

### Items
in sam's video:  
> Items section  


in -mgbmix-
> [!abstract]+ Item rules have been expanded beyond what's included in the vid:  
> - Equipping an Item costs [[1F]]
> - Using an ability on an equipped Item costs [[1F]] each time  

> [!success] Everything else is retained as-is, including cost & [[SWG]] stat interaction. 

### Tactics
> [!success] Vid has excess explanations, but it's essentially the same.

### Agenda

in sam's video:  
> Agenda section  


in -mgbmix-  
Didnt put much into it because they didn't exist in DROP01. For now, I plan that they can only be destroyed with a Discredit attack once the opponent's Active Zone is clear. Keeping the -1 Narrative mechanic upon destruction is fine.

### Plot Twists

in sam's vid:  
> Plot Twists section  

in -mgbmix-  
> [!abstract] Plot Twists have expanded rules and powers.  
> - Plot Twists can be activated from a player's [[Stowed Hand]], meaning they can be hidden while on the field waiting to be used.
> - Plot Twists cost nothing to activate and can be done whenever.
> - When a Plot Twist is activated, all Agendas and Tactics in play are sent to their owner's discard piles.

### Locations
> [!success] all the same, even the zero funding cost to play!

### Challenges
> [!success] Basically the same, though I enforce that the other player only gets the chance when the card is used in its [[Challenge#Free Contest Challenges|Free Contest mode]].

### Buffs
Buff and Debuffs: the same and expanded a bit so that Buffs, Skills, and Items inhabit unique design space.

### Groups
Groups: all the same EXCEPT only [[Discredit]] attacks can remove them.

### Skills

in sam's vid:  
> Skills section  


in -mgbmix-  
Skills cost 1F to play like Buffs, BUT they come into play unattached like Items do. Costs 1F to equip them. Cannot move the Skill after equipping.  
  
Rest is the same, like going to discard after creature is killed.  

### Incantations
 I have yet to see one of these cards.. haven't made any rules about them..  

### Infomashun
 > [!success] same 
 
> [!abstract] Actually, they also mention on this screen the "Golden Rule" about a card's text overruling the standard rules. This remains very true in -mgbmix-.

### How to Play
in sam's vid:  
> How to Play section  

in -mgbmix-  
#### Deckbuilding
> [!success] All the same on deckbuilding rules.

#### Opening Hands
> [!warning] 'Opening hands' are technically 7 cards for Player 1 and 10 cards for all other players. This is because Player 1 Turn 1 skips the [[Look Hand]]. No other turn has this condition.

#### Fistfights Determine First Player
> [!fail] No fistfights.

#### Resources per turn
> [!success] The same. 4 [[Funding]] and 3 new cards per turn.

### 'Not in my Mind'
in sam's vid:  
> "Not in my Mind" (core game feature)  

in -mgbmix-  
> [!fail] This 'feature' doesn't exist at all in my ruleset. 
 
That was actually the crux of me trying to create this ruleset, was to remove all the possible filibustering, lawyering, and gaslighting that Sam encourages in his video.  
  
Rather, for -mgbmix-,  
  
**The ultimate arbiter of -mgbmix- is the rules as stated in the -mgbmix- rulebook.**  
  
That's it. Intended by design as a regular, by-the-numbers game.  
That being said, I encourage players to make the most broken decks based on my ruleset in the making...  
  
### Closing

May  
your  
play.. be  
Good!  
  
  
Goodbye  ðŸ™‚
