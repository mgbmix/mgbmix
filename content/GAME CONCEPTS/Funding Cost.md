# Standardized Notation

> [!todo] Any time that a cost needs to be payed with [[Funding]], the amount will be denoted by a number followed by the letter F with no space between.

Most funding costs will be relatively low, such as [[0F]], [[1F]], [[2F]], [[3F]].  
Standard funding costs can also reach higher than that, such as [[4F]], [[5F]], [[6F]].  
These are all when considering the cost to deploy a single card.  

### Fixed Funding Cost

>[!example] Some card types have a fixed Funding cost to bring into play:
>
> [[CARD TYPES/Location|Locations]] & [[Challenge#Free Contest Challenges|free contest Challenges]] cost [[0F]]  
> [[Buff|Buffs]], [[Buff|Debuffs]], [[Plot Twist|Plot Twists]], & [[Skill|Skills]] cost [[1F]]  
> [[Item|Items]] & [[Tactic|Tactics]] cost [[2F]]  
> [[Group|Groups]] cost [[3F]]  
> [[Agenda|Agendas]] cost [[4F]]

### Rarity-based Funding Cost

> [!example] [[Creature]] & [[Challenge]] cards cost [[Funding]] points depending on their rarity 
> equal to 2F plus half that cardâ€™s rarity level (rounded down).
>
> [[R1]] = [[2F]]  
> [[R2]] = [[3F]]  
> [[R3]] = [[3F]]  
> [[R4]] = [[4F]]  
> [[R5]] = [[4F]]  
> [[R6]] = [[5F]]
