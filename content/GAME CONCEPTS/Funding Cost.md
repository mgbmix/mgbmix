# Standardized Notation

> [!todo] Any time that a cost needs to be payed with Funding, the amount will be denoted by a number followed by the letter F with no space between.

Most funding costs will be relatively low, such as [[0F]], [[1F]], [[2F]], [[3F]].  
Standard funding costs can also reach higher than that, such as [[4F]], [[5F]], [[6F]].  
These are all when considering the cost to deploy a single card.  

### Fixed Funding Cost

>[!example] Some card types have a fixed Funding cost to bring into play:
>
> Locations & free contest Challenges cost [[0F]]  
> Buffs, Debuffs, Plot Twists, & Skills cost [[1F]]  
> Items & Tactics cost [[2F]]  
> Groups cost [[3F]]  

### Rarity-based Funding Cost

> [!example] [[Creature]] & [[Challenge]] cards cost [[Funding]] points depending on their rarity 
> equal to 2F plus half that cardâ€™s rarity level (rounded down).
>
> [[R1]] = [[2F]]  
> [[R2]] = [[3F]]  
> [[R3]] = [[3F]]  
> [[R4]] = [[4F]]  
> [[R5]] = [[4F]]  
> [[R6]] = [[5F]]
