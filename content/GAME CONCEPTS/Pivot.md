Pivot is a game action that a player may do once per game.

The pivot action allows a player to swap their active Agenda card with another Agenda from their Hand at no Funding Cost. This does, however, cost the [[Seat|Seated]] [[Figurehead]] their end-of-turn action as they are occupied pivoting your side's Agenda. That means no [[Fundraise]] or [[Proselytize]] by them. Note the Agenda you just swapped in on pivot will be in play and can give you one Proselytize at no cost.
