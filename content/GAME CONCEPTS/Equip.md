Equip is an action a player can use to [[attach]] Item and Skill cards to valid [[Target|targets]].

> [!note] [[Funding Cost]]

Since Items and Skills enter play unattached to anything, the player may wait and decide later how to use them. At that point, they pay the Equip cost and attach the card to its target.
