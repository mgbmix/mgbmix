Fundraising is a [[Think Tank Actions|Think Tank action]] performed by a Seated [[Figurehead]] at the end of that player's turn.


> [!abstract] Receive additional [[Funding]] if, at the end of turn, the player has a [[Figurehead]] seated in the [[Think Tank]] and the player chooses to [[Fundraise]]. 

> [!warning]+ Additional Funding from Fundraising depends on Seated Figurehead’s [[INT]] stat:  
> 1 – 4 INT provides 1 Funding  
> 5 – 9 INT provides 2 Funding  
> 10+ INT provides 3 Funding  

> [!fail] A player who uses the Seated Figurehead to Fundraise cannot use them to also [[Proselytize]] in the same turn.
