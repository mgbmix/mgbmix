Stowing is a game action performed by the player during one of their turns.

> [!note] [[Funding Cost]]
The Stow action costs [[1F]] per card being stowed.

After paying the cost, the player puts a card from their [[Look Hand]] face-down into their [[Stowed Hand]], which exists in the player's [[Think Tank]] area.
