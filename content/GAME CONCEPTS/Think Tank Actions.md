aliases:
  - Think Tank action

The [[Think Tank]] zone starts empty. To get the most out of your [[Think Tank]], you will need to perform various game actions, some of which will require specific cards while others are generally available to use. Your Think Tank also has some passive abilities.

## Think Tank Action: Seating

[[Seat]] a [[Creature]] of the [[Figurehead]] [[subtype]] within your [[Think Tank]]. 

Seating is a free action that moves a [[Figurehead]] from the [[Active Zone]] to the player's [[Think Tank]]. Likewise, Unseating is a free action that moves a [[Figurehead]] out of the Think Tank and back to the Active Zone. 

> [!abstratc] A player may either Seat or Unseat once per each of their turns.

> [!fail] A player cannot Seat or Unseat during another player’s turn.

> [!warning] A maximum of one [[Figurehead]] may be seated in a player’s Think Tank at any time. 

## Seating unrelated to summoning sickness

Seating and Unseating are Think Tank actions and have no relation to [[summoning sickness]]. 

In other words: 
 - A creature that just entered play may be seated 
 - An unseated creature returning to Active Zone does not become summoning sick 


## Think Tank Passive: Protection

The [[Figurehead]] seated within a Think Tank is protected. That creature cannot be [[Target|targeted]] with attacks, abilities, etc. until all creatures in that player’s [[Active Zone]] are gone. At the same time, a seated Figurehead in a Think Tank cannot attack or use abilities either. Instead, they are used at the end of turn to [[Fundraise]] (gain [[Funding]]) or [[Proselytize]] (advance [[Narrative Score|Narrative]]).
