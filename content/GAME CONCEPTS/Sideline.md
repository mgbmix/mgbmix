Sideline is a term used to describe when a card in play has expended its uses or is otherwise unusable. This is demonstrated on the game board by turning the card sideways instead of upright.

Left: Upright. Right: Sidelined.

### Some Effects Cause Cards to Become Sidelined

#### Plot Twists Sideline Agendas and Tactics

Most commonly, all Plot Twist cards have an effect that causes Agendas and Tactics to become sidelined, meaning that can't be used that turn.

> [!todo] Tip
> That means you should activate a Plot Twist on the opponent's turn so their Agenda cannot Proselytize at the end of their turn!

### Creatures Get Sidelined After Using Them

If, on your turn, you expend all the actions they can perform (depending on stat-based capabilities).

> [!note] Example
> The [[0120 - TK Knight|TK Knight]] in the image above has SWG below 5, so it cannot perform attacks and abilities in the same turn. However, both its FYT and NRG are at 5 or above, meaning it can do two attacks or two abilities in one turn before being completely exerted. Let's say you use the TK Knight to do two STR-based Physical Attacks. After the second one, you would sideline the Creature to show that it cannot be used anymore that turn.

## Important Rules

### Sidelined <u>Does Not</u> Mean Out of Play

A sidelined Creature in the Active Zone still blocks the way to a player's Think Tank. You must kill them or otherwise remove them from play before reaching the Seated Figurehead or other cards in the Think Tank.

#### Connection to Magic: the Gathering

This is obviously my namechange for tapping cards in magic.
