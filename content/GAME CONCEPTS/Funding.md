Funding is the game’s primary resource for spending on cards, abilities, etc.

# Standard ways to gain Funding:

> [!todo] Receive 20 Funding during [[Initial Deployment]] at start of game

> [!todo] Receive 4 Funding from the [[Think Tank]] at the start of each turn aside from the player’s initial turn. This amount is guaranteed.

> [!abstract] Receive additional Funding if, at the end of turn, the player has a [[Figurehead]] seated in the [[Think Tank]] and the player chooses to [[Fundraise]]. 

> [!warning]+ Additional Funding from Fundraising depends on Seated Figurehead’s [[INT]] stat:  
> 1 – 4 INT provides 1 Funding  
> 5 – 9 INT provides 2 Funding  
> 10+ INT provides 3 Funding  

# Funding Loop

Specific cards or abilities might have other ways to get Funding, but this is the basic Funding loop for the game: 

- Get 20 during [[Initial Deployment]] and create your initial boardstate
- Get 4-7 to spend per turn, depending on the use of [[Fundraise]] and your Figurehead's [[INT]]

> [!abstract] Funding can be saved up and used on later turns, stored up to a max of 20.
