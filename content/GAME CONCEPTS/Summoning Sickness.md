'Summoning sickness' is a term and concept invented by the creators of Mondo Megabits.

It is a state that all creatures have on the turn they entered a player's control. 
Basically, if a creature was under your control at the start of your turn, it is not summoning sick that turn. 

Summoning sickness is a negative state that limits the actions of the creature.

> [!fail] A summoning sick creature cannot:
> - [[Attack]] (either [[STR]] or [[INT]] attacks)
> - Activate its own abilities
> - Activate equipped abilities for cards you control
