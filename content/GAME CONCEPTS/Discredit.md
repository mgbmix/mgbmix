# Discredit - The Memetic Attack

### General Rules About Discrediting

#### It's a form of attack, which means...
- Creatures cannot do a [[STR]]-based regular attack and an [[INT]]-based Discredit attack unless their [[FYT]] stat is high enough to allow for additional fighting.
- Creatures cannot Discredit and use abilities in the same turn unless their [[SWG]] stat is five or higher. 

## The Discredit Attack Answers Multiple Threats

### Attacking Opponent's Narrative Score

Discrediting an opposing [[Narrative Score|Narrative]] is an effective way of winning a memetic war. After all, talking shit about another viewpoint is way easier than justifying one’s own. 

> [!warning]+ There are limitations to when a player may use Discredit attacks.
>
> - Only creatures with [[INT]] 8 or higher can Discredit the enemy Narrative.  
> - If Creatures are present in the opponent’s [[Active Zone]], no Discredit attacks may be used.  
> - If the Active Zone is clear but the enemy [[Think Tank]] has a [[Seat|seated]] [[Figurehead]], a single Creature with remaining actions may Discredit the opponent’s Narrative.  
> - If the enemy Active Zone and [[Think Tank]] are both clear, any number of Creatures  with remaining actions may Discredit the opponent’s Narrative.  

#### Additional Notes on Discredit Attacks Targeting Narrative

- Discredit attacks do not alter the [[HP]] of the opponent’s seated [[Figurehead]].



### Dismantling Agenda & Group Cards in Play 

#### Agendas

Agenda cards may be discredited once the opposing Active Zone is empty of Creatures. 

#### Groups

Group cards may be discredited once the opposing Active Zone is empty of Creatures belonging to the same Faction matching that of the Group card. 

> [!warning] Note
> This means a Group card may be discredited (and removed from play) while its controller still has Creatures in their Active Zone if they have no factionally aligned Creatures in play to support the Group.
