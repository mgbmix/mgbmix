Seating is a game action the player may take to put one of their [[Figurehead]] Creatures into their [[Think Tank]] from their Active Zone to unlock the end-of-turn abilities [[Proselytize]] and [[Fundraise]].

Normally, Creatures exist in the [[Active Zone]] while in play and are not placed in the Think Tank. That's why it takes a special action to move a Figurehead there.

## Additional Rules

>[!info] A player make take a seating action once per active turn. 

> [!warning] Only Creatures of the [[Figurehead]] subtype are allowed to be Seated.

> [!warning] Only one Figurehead may be seated in a player's Think Tank at any time.



### Seating and Unseating

Seating is a free action that moves a [[Figurehead]] from the Active Zone to the Think Tank. Likewise, Unseating is a free action that moves a [[Figurehead]] out of the Think Tank and back to the Active Zone.
