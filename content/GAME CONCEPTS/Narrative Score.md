The Narrative Score is the ultimate gauge of a player’s progress in the game. 

It ranges from -5 to +5, with each extreme being instant defeat or victory.

### Narrative Score Range

-5: Your narrative is a conspiracy theory
-4: Rogan-tier
-3: Highly unlikely but still believed by anti-social types
-2: Sounds fishy (think princess Diana)
-1: “Hmmm...”
0: Starting point. Neutral state of acceptance. Hypothetically possible TED talk level
+1: Gaining traction with “academics”
+2: Science-backed
+3: Taught to kindergartners
+4: Your narrative MUST be believed to hold a job or rent an apartment / car
+5: Your narrative is a fundamental, underlying truth which cannot be escaped
