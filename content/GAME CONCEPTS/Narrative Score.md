The Narrative Score is the ultimate gauge of a player’s progress in the game. 

It ranges from -5 to +5, with each extreme being instant defeat or victory.

### Narrative Score Range

-5: Your narrative is a conspiracy theory  
-4: Rogan-tier  
-3: Highly unlikely but still believed by anti-social types  
-2: Sounds fishy (think princess Diana)  
-1: “Hmmm...”  
0: Starting point. Neutral state of acceptance. Hypothetically possible TED talk level  
+1: Gaining traction with “academics”  
+2: Science-backed  
+3: Taught to kindergartners  
+4: Your narrative MUST be believed to hold a job or rent an apartment / car  
+5: Your narrative is a fundamental, underlying truth which cannot be escaped  


### Affecting Narrative Score

> [!note] Gaining Narrative Score
> - One way to increase Narrative Score by +1 is to use the [[Seat|Seated]] [[Figurehead]] to [[Proselytize]] ([[4F]] [[Funding Cost|cost]]). 
> - Another way to increase Narrative Score by +1 is to control an [[Agenda]] card at the end of your turn and use it to Proselytize at no further cost.

> [!note] Attacking Narrative Score
> To decrease opponent’s Narrative Score by -1, use a [[Creature]] capable of performing a [[Discredit]] attack. (Limitations exist to when Discredit attacks may be done.)


#### Other Points on Narrative Score

- The concept of your "Narrative" within the game doesn't matter, you don't need to make up a story or a lore-based goal to win the game. It's a finish line.
