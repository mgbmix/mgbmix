  <text>Rarity: R4 Funding Cost: 1F

This Buff enters play attached to a Creature card you control.
When the buffed Creature leaves play, send this card to discard.

[Predestined to Play] At some future point in the game you can pay this card's cost--you don't have to right this instant (don't forget).
You actually can't pay the cost to play right now--it would create a time paradox. You need to wait several turns.
Until you pay the cost to play, you cannot win the game.
If you forget to pay the cost to play--even if you make it through the rest of the game, and your opponent forgets that you forgot to pay the cost to play, and both of you agree that you are the winner--if at any future date either of you remembers that you forgot to pay the cost to play, you will then retroactively be declared the loser. 

[Clockmaster] Choose an effect from the buffed creature with a duration measured in turns.
Roll a d6, call the result Clyde.
You may make that effect last Clyde turns instead of its normal duration.

[Liftoff] As soon as this card is drawn, the controller may put it into play. If they do, all cards with odd-numbered rarity rankings get launched into space (destroyed). 
Each player may draw half of the number of cards lost. All players draw new cards. You wanted this. This is good.
View enemy's newly drawn hand - choose two (2) cards to remove.

[False Hope Hoax] Planet B is actually a projection on a giant dinner plate floating in space. There is no liftoff.
