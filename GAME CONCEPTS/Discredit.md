Discrediting an opposing Narrative is an effective way of winning a memetic war. After all, talking shit about another viewpoint is way easier than justifying one’s own. 

> [!warning]+ There are limitations to when a player may use Discredit attacks.
>
> - Only creatures with [[INT]] 8 or higher can Discredit the enemy Narrative.  
> - If Creatures are present in the opponent’s [[Active Zone]], no Discredit attacks may be used.  
> - If the Active Zone is clear but the enemy [[Think Tank]] has a [[Seat|seated]] Figurehead, a single Creature with remaining actions may Discredit the opponent’s Narrative.  
> - If the enemy Active Zone and Think Tank are both clear, any number of Creatures  with remaining actions may Discredit the opponent’s Narrative.  

#### Additional Notes on Discredit Attacks

- Discredit attacks do not alter the HP of the opponent’s seated Figurehead.
- Creatures cannot do a [[STR]]-based regular attack and an [[INT]]-based Discredit attack unless their [[FYT]] stat is high enough to allow for additional fighting.
- Creatures cannot Discredit and use abilities in the same turn unless their [[SWG]] stat is five or higher.
